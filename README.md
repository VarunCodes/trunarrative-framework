## Tech Stack

| Tech | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Selenium WebDriver | Web automation framework |
| Cucumber | Automation tool supporting BDD and the Gherkin syntax |
| Maven | Provides version control for dependencies and project file structure |
| TestNG | Testing framework for test case functionality |

## Misc

| Tech | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Tidy Gherkin | Browser-based plugin for generating stepDefinitions using Feature steps |

## My approach
> Using Maven to create a filestructure which facilitates Cucumber's BDD syntax

> Adding the correct dependencies for Selenium, JUnit, and Cucumber

> Writing Feature file (Gherkin syntax) based on MVP requirements

> Creating a testBase class for generic methods and connecting it with data.properties

> Integrating stepDefinitions/Cucumber and TestNG by creating a TestRunner file
